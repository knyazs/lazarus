# Introduction

AI for corporate artefacts. Automate info processing, enhance collaboration and streamline decision-making with ML-powered insights.

Lazarus is an innovative Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) system designed to transform the way organizations handle information, communication, and collaboration. Named after the legendary figure who rose from the dead, Lazarus breathes new life into corporate artefacts, bringing them to the forefront of productivity and knowledge management.

Lazarus is built on a cutting-edge neural network system that specializes in scanning and analyzing various company artefacts such as emails, documents, current apps and more. Its primary goal is to harness the power of AI to enhance user experiences and streamline operations across the enterprise.

# Key Features

1. **Artifact Scanning:** Lazarus scans and comprehends company artefacts, extracting valuable insights and knowledge.
2. **Question-Answering Model:** It builds an intelligent model capable of answering user questions based on processed artefacts.
3. **Active Listening:** Lazarus goes beyond answering questions; it actively listens to users, extracting context and intent from their inputs.
4. **Conversational Storytelling:** The system generates meaningful narratives and stories from user interactions, connecting the dots and making information more accessible.
5. **Automated Collaboration:** Lazarus identifies and involves the right people in conversations, facilitating more productive discussions and decision-making.
6. **Discussion Classification:** It automatically categorizes discussions, questions, announcements, and service requests, making it easier to manage and prioritize tasks.

# Benefits

- **Efficiency:** Lazarus automates information processing, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **Knowledge Enrichment:** It uncovers hidden insights within company artefacts, enriching the organization's collective knowledge.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** The system fosters effective collaboration by bringing the right people into the conversation.
- **Improved Decision-Making:** By providing quick and accurate answers, Lazarus supports data-driven decision-making processes.
- **Scalability:** Lazarus can adapt to various industries and domains, making it a versatile tool for businesses of all sizes.

# Architecture

Lazarus adopts a sophisticated dual-plane architecture, a powerful framework that maximizes system capabilities. This architecture is designed to streamline the separation of key components, ensuring efficiency and scalability.

1. **Lazarus Plane:** This plane represents the core of the system, housing all the intricate logic and software code. It serves as the brain of the operation, where AI algorithms, natural language processing, and data analysis come together to provide advanced functionalities. Here, continuous learning and model improvement take place, enabling Lazarus to adapt and enhance its capabilities over time.

2. **User's Plane:** In contrast, the user's plane is where the valuable models and data reside. This is the repository of insights, user-specific information, and the heart of the AI's knowledge base. Users contribute to this plane by supplying essential data, and it's where personalized interactions and responses are generated.

The division between these two planes ensures data security, user privacy, and the efficient use of computational resources. It also facilitates a dynamic learning process. By separating the code from the user-specific data, Lazarus can update and improve its AI models without compromising sensitive information. It's a robust and flexible architecture that enables the AI system to evolve and become increasingly valuable to companies.

This dual-plane architecture not only empowers Lazarus to answer questions and create meaningful conversations but also underlines its commitment to safeguarding user data while delivering unparalleled AI-driven solutions.
